## Installation

This project requires Node.js version >= 12.X.X

Installation

```
npm install
```

or

```
yarn install
```

## Usage

By default, the program will try to read `/tmp/access.log`

```
npm run start
```

You can precise which file the program should read thanks to the `-f` or `--file` flag.

```
npm run start -f path_to_logfile
```

A demo is also available through the `-d` or `--demo` flag. It will read an `access.log` file present in the `logs` folder.

```
npm run start --demo
```

The program displays new http requests every `10` seconds in the file.
In addition to displaying the logs of the file, the program also displays a summary of the last data retrieved.

The period during which the program reads the log file can be modified in the `.env` file at the root of the project (`PERIOD` variable).

Finally, if you want to see only the logs lines without the statistics, you can use the `-r` or `--raw` flag.

```
npm run start --raw
```
